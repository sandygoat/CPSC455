# Rate the Turf

## App Description

Top of README – clear description of app (can be like an elevator pitch!) [2-3 sentences]: !!! <br>
This application allows users to find a turf based on the rating of the turf and the distance from the location of the user to the turf. User is also able to view the image of the turf to see if it fits their preference.

## Project Goals
### Minimal:

1. :heavy_check_mark: Search: 
  * Find the turf or playland or anywhere green on Map that provides leisure activities.
2. :heavy_check_mark: Comment: 
  - Allow users to leave comments on a specific nearby location.
  - All users are able to read others' comments.
  - Allow users to delete their comments
3. :heavy_check_mark: Rate:
  - Allow individual user to rate the the turf and keep the record for future reference
4. :heavy_check_mark: Favorite:
  - Users are able to save/unsave places by clicking the favorite button
5. :heavy_check_mark: Rating:
  - Users can leave rating on particular place they have visited , which could be shared with other users later
6. :heavy_check_mark: User System:
  - Registeration for new users and log in system for returning users
 
### Standard:

1.  Filter results based on ratings
2.  Sort by distance from user
3. :heavy_check_mark: Pictures
4. :heavy_check_mark: Trip Planner:
  - In the favorite tab, users can directly find the route to the destination via the trip planner tool. In this tool, routes by multiple transportation tools can be provided as well as a link directly to the goole map with desinated route loaded.


### Advanced:

1. :heavy_check_mark: Add friends[partially completed]:
  - partially completed by the subscrib and notify feature, where subscribers will be updated by the latest ratings from their following users. 
2. Create chatting/meetup function
3. Third-party login
4. :heavy_check_mark: Enable cookies
5. :heavy_check_mark: Subscribe and Notify feature:
  - Users can subscribe other users by searching their username in the Subscribe tab. Upon subcription, the subcribers will be notified by the new ratings made by the watched users.

## Tech Stasck
Description on how tech from Units 1-5 are used in the project. See rubric item #2 for a sense of what we’re looking for in this description. [2-3 sentences each]
Description of usage explains in-depth how the technology has made the app better. Possibly a mention of how it compares to other similar tech. Documentation demonstrates a solid understanding of the tech learned throughout the term, and its purpose in creating a production-level full-stack web application.

Unit 1 - HTML, CSS, JS
HTML is used within TSX to render React components.
CSS is used for styling React components.
JavaScript is used for implementing client-side and server-side logic, but for the frontend, we chose to use TypeScript instead to make the code easier to understand, to debug, and to take advantage of static checking.

Unit 2 - React & Redux
React is used to create components to build the frontend.
Redux is used to store and organize the application’s state.
Redux stores and manages the entire state of the application in one place, optimizing UI performance and React Redux makes it easy to get the two working together seamlessly.

Unit 3 - MongoDB
MongoDB is used to store the bulk of our data including songs, queues, default playlists, user profiles, and chat messages.
Since MongoDB is a non-relational, document oriented database management system, it’s significantly faster and easier to use than a traditional database system. MongoDB Atlas also provides a simple and easy alternative to using the command line to access the database.

Unit 4 - Node & Express
Node.js is used for backend API services and server-side logic.
Express provides server-side logic through routing, request handling, and endpoints.
Node.js and Express easily integrate with MongoDB with Mongoose to provide a backend for our app.

Unit 5 - Release Engineering
Musico is deployed on Heroku with continuous integration enabled.
Used Heroku’s student plan to deploy it on a Hobby Dyno for a more stable and reliable website experience

## Above and Beyond
Description of ‘Above and Beyond’ functionality. Please give a clear description and in-depth explanation of how you went above and beyond the requirements of the course. This will help us awards marks for rubric item #4.

Project goes beyond the basic requirements by incorporating one to a few “extra” requirements. Some examples could be: Fully responsive, fully accessible, uses external APIs, implements a complex algorithm, utilizes ML/AI, did research for UX, supports multiple languages and/or timezones, uses location services, integrates with social media.

## Next Steps
Description of Next Steps. What would you do next to further improve the app, or add additional relevant functionality? You may want to reference your in-progress or incomplete goals in this section. [2-3 sentences]
Documentation clearly describes specific, relevant goals that would continue to improve upon the functionality or usability of the app. It is clear how this would be incorporated into the existing app.

## List of contributions
. Highlight areas where each team member contributed significantly. [2-3 sentences per team member]
It is very clear which team member worked on which parts of the application. The documentation describes at least one area/issue/technology where each team member took a substantial leadership role, and that team member’s contribution is reflected in the project.
